Android application (prototype) created during the [NASA space apps challenge 2017](https://2017.spaceappschallenge.org/).

### Features


#### Send GPS location of an habitat

The user can move a marker on Google Maps to select the location of an habitat. After filling up some other information, the user can send his report to our server.

#### Show the nearest habitat

Based on the current location of the user the application shows the nearest habitat on Google Maps (see nearest.png).


There is no connection to a backend server, the data are fake (it's just a prototype).
