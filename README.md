Android application (prototype) created during the [NASA space apps challenge 2017](https://2017.spaceappschallenge.org/).

Link to our [team project](https://2017.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/our-ecological-neighborhood/migratory-travels-and-travel-stories/teams/gratitude-to-the-crane/project).

This application has 2 features:

- send the GPS location of an habitat
- show the nearest habitat based on the current location of the user

There is no connection to a backend server, the data are fake (it's just a prototype).
